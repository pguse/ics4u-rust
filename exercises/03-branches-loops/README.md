# Branches and Loops

In Visual Studio Code, create a folder called **BranchesLoops** and then open it. Now open a new Terminal window. 

## Exercises

## 03-0: At Least One Odd Number?
In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in **BranchesLoops** called *one_odd.rs*.  Use the source code provided below as starter code in your file.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create variables with values
    let a = 10;
    let b = 15;

    // Is at least one value even?
    // Note != is the NOT EQUAL TO operator
    if a%2 == 0 || b%2 == 0 {
       println!("YES");
    } else {
       println!("NO");
    }
}
```

Modify the source code so that it determines if at **least one of 3** given numbers is **odd**.  Currently, the source code is checking whether at least one of 2 numbers is even.

**Output:**  print "YES" if at least one of 3 numbers is odd and print "NO" otherwise.


## 03-1: Ascending Integers?

In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in **BranchesLoops** called *ascending_int.rs*.  Use the source code provided below as starter code in your file.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create variables with values
    let a = 10;
    let b = 15;
    let c = 20;

    // Are these values descending?
    if a > b && b > c {
        println!("YES");
    } else {
        println!("NO");
    }
}
```

Modify the source code so that it determines whether 4 variables: *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* contain **ascending integer values**.

 **Output:** print YES if they're given in ascending order, print NO otherwise.


## 03-2: Multiplication Table  
In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in **BranchesLoops** called *mult_table.rs*.  Use the source code provided below as starter code in your file.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 5;

    for i in 1..11 {
        println!("{} x {} = ", number, i);
    }
}
```
Modify the source code so that the multiplication table for the variable *number* is printed out up to 10.  For example,

### Expected Output:
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
â€¦
5 x 10 = 50
```
## 03-3: Divisors
In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in **BranchesLoops** called *divisors.rs*.  Modify the starter code below so that it outputs **all the divisors** of a number given as input.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 12;

    print!("Divisors of {}: ", number);

    for i in 1..(12+1) {

        // Is the remainder of (number / i) equal to zero?

        print!("{} ",i);
    }
}
```

### Expected Output:
```
Divisors of 12: 1 2 3 4 6 12
```

## 03-4: Perfect Numbers
In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in **BranchesLoops** called *perfect.rs*.  The **divisors** of a **perfect number** ***(except for the number itself)*** add up to the number. For example: 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 6 and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So, 6 is a perfect number. Modify the starter code so that it determines whether a number is **perfect**.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 12;
    let mut sum = 0;

    for i in 1..number {

    // Is the remainder of (number / i) equal to zero?

        sum = sum + i;
    }

    if sum == number {
        println!("The number {} is a perfect number.", number);
    }
}
```

For ```let number = 6```

### Expected Output:
```
The number 6 is a perfect number.
```

For ```let number = 10```

### Expected Output:
```
The number 10 is NOT a perfect number.
```
